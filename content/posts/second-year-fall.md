I want to continue what I started with the first blog post on discussing first-year courses.
# 1st: ECE241
## My Review
- You learn a lot of content but don't dive too deep into it; if you're especially interested in something, you need to learn it on your own.
- Labs are quite fun, if not the greatest olfactory experience. They reflect lecture content and teach out about digital hardware design/verification.
- As daunting as the project seems, much of the stress/pressure is what students bring on themselves; the instructors' expectations for the project are significantly lower than what I thought they'd be.
## Tips
- ModelSim ModelSim ModelSim (did I forget ModelSim?)
- Practice your Boolean algebra consistently instead of trying to cram it all before the midterm and the final.
- Make good use of the textbook, it's well-written for a second year audience.

# 2nd: ECE231
## My Review
- Course schedule was unclear at times, and the instructors aren't on the same page regarding what should be taught and when.
- Content itself is great and sets a good foundation for future electronics courses.
- The first two or three labs are quite a snooze but they pick up in iddifculty (and in how fun they are) very quickly.
## Tips
- In addition to the pre-lab exercises, take a good luck at what you'll be doing in the lab itself. It will save you a lot of time debugging and you won't be as dependent on the TAs, who are busy.
- It seems easy to get away with memorizing a lof of the content in the course, but I believe doing that stops you from actually learning anything.
- Remember that even if you get lost or stuck on a question, you can solve any problem in the whole course using just Ohm's Law, Kirchoff's Laws, and element equations.

# 3rd: MAT290
## My Review
- Two sections being significantly behind the other two made studying for the weekly quizzes quite annoying as we'd be doing questions on content covered one or two weeks ago.
- The course covers a lot of content but does a good job of tying everything together by the end of the course. 
- We could benefit from learning more engineering applications than just basic RLC circuits that we already know how to solve.
## Tips
- Practice makes better.
- Don't rely too much on the past quizzes.
# 4th: ECE244
## My Review
- A pretty standard programming course.
- The first and last two labs were extremely boring but the middle two made me a little more optimistic about programming and it's applications.
## Tips
- Use the reference executables when in doubt.
- Don't bother doing the textbook problems; just do the past midterms and exams they're taken from.

# 5th: MAT291
## My Review
- Again, practice makes better.
- Use the textbook and the instructor-provided lecture notes. They cover far more content and examples than what is actually presented in the lecture.
## Tips
- I actually had no clue what I was doing throughout this course I can't really say anything :(
