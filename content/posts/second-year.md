I receive a lot of DMs asking me to give feedback on second-year ECE courses, so here I've provided the class average of each course and my best piece of advice for success in the course.

# Fall Semester

### ECE231: Introductory Electronics (C+)
- Don't try to memorize the circuit types and different types of problems, make sure you understand why they work the way they do.

### ECE241: Digital Systems (C+)
- Practice your Boolean Algebra, it makes up a large portion of your midterm (which again is a large portion of your grade). Make sure to cook your final project, as having something eye-catching can make your resume stronger, and get you more interviews (and offers :eyes:)

### ECE244: Programming Fundamentals (B-)
- Turn off your brain when doing the labs, don't think hard (ideally don't think at all). Follow the lab instructions to the tee, and you'll cover 95% of corner cases as well. 

### MAT290: Advanced Engineering Mathematics (B-)
- The math is very difficult, and it's important to keep up because of the weekly quizzes, but try to understand the bigger picture being painted throughout the course. Keep an open mind and you'll learn a lot about the history and elegance of math!

### MAT291: Introduction to Mathematical Physics (B-)
- Keep up even as the course speeds up, because understanding the latter part of the course is critical to your success in ECE221.

# Winter Semester

### ECE212: Circuit Analysis (B)
- This is your third circuit course, so PLEASE make sure you know how to use the lab equipment by now. Also, use the textbook to pactice a lot, as it will expose you to a variety of problems.

### ECE216: Signals and Systems (C+)
- The math in the course, while complex, is kept simple by limiting what you have to solve on midterms and the final. However, make sure you understand the theory (the how and the why).  

### ECE221: Electric and Magnetic Fields (C+)
- Do not neglect the physics portion of the course and focus only on the math. Also, try not to screw up the pre-lab quizzes as those count for a fair portion of your grade.

### ECE243: Computer Organization (B)
- Cook your final project for the clout (and bonus marks :eyes:) but also for your resume! While most people end up doing simple games or apps, integrating hardware into your project adds some embedded programming experience. 

### ECE297: Software Design and Communication (B+)
- The effort applied vs. earned marks in this course has diminishing returns, so while it's not a good idea to forget about the course entirely, it's not worth sweating too hard.

# Summer Semester

### JRE410: Markets and Competitive Strategy
- ngl i barely have any marks back so i cant even tell you how i did. come back later.
