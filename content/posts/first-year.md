I receive a lot of DMs asking me to give feedback on first-year engineering courses, so here I've provided the class average of each course and my best piece of advice for success in the course.

# Fall Semester

### APS100: Orientation to Engineering (H/P/F)
- Get to know your TA and listen when they talk about their experiences, they were once in your shoes and have valuable advice for how to make the best of your student experience, whether it comes to careers, clubs, or school-life balance.

### APS110: Engineering Chemistry and Materials Science (B-)
- The course follows the textbook very closely, so make sure to take very good textbook notes (don't forget the questions!) then add extra content based on lecture discussions.


### APS111: Engineering Strategies and Practice I (B)
- The readings, while tedious, are very applicable to real life, from clubs to industry roles. Also, make sure yo use every opportunity to earn the extra PD points!

### CIV100: Mechanics (C+)
- If you like this course, good for you, but if you're indifferent (or miserable), then do your best to pass and move on with your life. Practice, practice, practice!

### MAT186: Calculus I (C)
- A lot of people underestimate this course because they have covered the content in high school, but beware that this is a completely different ball game, so make sure that you understand the fundamentals.

### MAT188: Linear Algebra (B-)
- Practice, practice, practice!!! Make sure you understand the concepts very well. 

# Winter Semester

### APS105: Computer Fundamentals (B)
- C has a lot of neat quirks that makes it powerful but also requires memorization and an understanding of why low-level programming works the way it does, so pay attention to the little details.

### APS106: Fundamentals of Computer Programming (C+)
- Use the low averages to ride the curve to the top! 

### APS112: Engineering Strategies and Practice II (B-)
- As with ESP I, take advantage of the opportunities to add the extra PD points to your grade.

### ECE110: Electrical Fundamentals (B-)
- Go to tutorials and ask as many questions to your TA as you need. Don't bother putting down past questions (or full exams) on your formula sheet, it's a waste of space and the instructors rarely recycle questions.

### MAT187: Calculus II (B-)
- Practice, practice, practice!!!!

### MIE100: Dynamics (C+)
- Don't fall for the "MIE is harder than CIV" ragebait. Also, practice lots and make sure you understand theory instead of trying to memorize question types.

### MIE191: Introduction to Mechanical and Industrial Engineering (CR/NCR)
- Lectures are optional but very useful! You have the opportunity to learn a lot about careers in your discipline, meet alumni, as well as some professors (who may take on research intens :eyes:) Keep in mind, not all 191 courses are structured the same, I can only speak to the MIE version.
