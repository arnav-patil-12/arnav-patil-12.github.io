## Hello!

My name is Arnav, and I'm a second-year Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) student at the University of Toronto. I'm interested in learning about and working in computer hardware and machine intelligence.

Outside of classes, I'm involved with the University of Toronto Engineering Society (EngSoc) and the IEEE University of Toronto Student Branch (IEEE UofT).

Feel free to reach out, I'm always looking to connect!
