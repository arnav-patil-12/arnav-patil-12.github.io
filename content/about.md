I'm studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto. My interests lie at the intersection of computer hardware and software; I'm open to roles in computer/FPGA architecture and digital design. 

In summer 2025, I interned at Prof. Roman Genov's [Intelligent Sensory Microsystems Lab (ISML)](https://www.eecg.utoronto.edu/~roman/lab/index.html) as an FPGA Researcher. In this role, I wrote Verilog firmware to control a novel depth-imaging camera and dabbled in digital design/verification in Cadence Virtuoso.

This fall, I've taken on a Teaching Assistant position for [APS100 (Orientation to Engineering)](https://engineering.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/aps100h1), helping students transition to post-secondary life and build their academic skillsets.
