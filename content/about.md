Iâ€™m a second-year student studying Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of Toronto. My interests lie in computer hardware and digital electronics (FPGAs/ASICs) for use in AIML.

This summer, I'll be working at Prof. Roman Genov's [Intelligent Sensory Microsystems Lab (ISML)](https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~roman/lab/index.html) on FPGAs and active sensor pixel cameras. More updates to come!
