Iâ€™m studying Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of Toronto. My interests lie in computer hardware and digital electronics (FPGAs/ASICs).

This summer, I'm working at Prof. Roman Genov's [Intelligent Sensory Microsystems Lab (ISML)](https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~roman/lab/index.html) as an FPGA Research Intern! Iâ€™m working on high-speed mixed-signal design for next-generation 3D imaging systems.
