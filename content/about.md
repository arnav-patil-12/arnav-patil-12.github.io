I’m studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto, where I enjoy working at the intersection of hardware and software, especially computer architecture and digital design. 

In summer 2025, I interned as an FPGA engineer at Prof. Roman Genov’s [Intelligent Sensory Microsystems Lab (ISML)](https://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~roman/lab/index.html), refining my Verilog skills and dabbling in digital design. 

Currently, I'm TA'ing [APS100 (Orientation to Engineering)](https://engineering.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/aps100h1), helping first-year students transition into university life.
