I’m a second-year student studying Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of Toronto. My interests lie in computer hardware and digital electronics (FPGAs/ASICs) for use in AIML.

This summer, I'll be joining Prof. Roman Genov's [Intelligent Sensory Microsystems Lab (ISML)](https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~roman/lab/index.html) as an FPGA Research Intern! I’ll be working on high-speed digital design for next-generation 3D imaging systems. My role entails FPGA-controlled laser modulation and real-time synchronization for Epipolar Time-of-Flight imaging, blending hardware design, signal processing, and system-level integration to bring new innovations in imaging technology.
