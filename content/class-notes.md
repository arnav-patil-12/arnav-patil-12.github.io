On this page, I've curated a collection of my course notes. These course notes are mainly final exam review or transcribed textbook or lecture notes. **While none of these notes packages are full representations of the course**, I found them incredibly helpful in preparation for assessments.

Unfortunately, there's some courses, especially in Fall semester of my first year, where I didn't take notes or the notes were provided by the instructor. 

## First Year

[APS110: Engineering Chemistry and Materials Science](/files/firstyear/aps110.pdf)

[APS111: Engineering Strategies & Practice I]()

[MAT224/MAT188: Linear Algebra II]() - tentative, not confirmed

### Winter Semester
