On this page, I've curated a collection of my course notes. These course notes are mainly final exam review or transcribed textbook/lecture notes. While **none of these notes are a full representations of the course**, I found them incredibly helpful over the course of the semester, or in preparation for assessments.

## First Year
### Fall
[APS110: Engineering Chemistry and Materials Science](/files/firstyear/aps110.pdf)

[APS111: Engineering Strategies & Practice I]() (Coming next!)

[MAT224/MAT188: Linear Algebra]() - tentative, not confirmed

Unfortunately, there's some courses for which I don't have notes available to share :(

### Winter
[APS106: Fundamentals of Computer Programming](/files/firstyear/aps106.pdf)

[APS112: Engineering Strategies & Practice II](/files/firstyear/aps112.pdf)

ECE110: Electrical Fundamentals [(Textbook Notes)](/files/firstyear/ece110tb.pdf) and [(Lecture Notes)]()

[MAT187: Calculus 2](/files/firstyear/mat187.pdf)

[MIE100: Dynamics](/files/firstyear/mie100.pdf)

### Summer
