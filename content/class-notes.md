On this page, I've curated a collection of my course notes. These course notes are mainly final exam review or transcribed textbook/lecture notes. While **none of these notes are a full representation of the course**, I found them incredibly helpful over the course of the semester, or in preparation for assessments.

Last Update: APS105 -- code block extra line removed.

## First Year
### Fall
[APS110: Engineering Chemistry and Materials Science](/files/firstyear/aps110.pdf)

[APS111: Engineering Strategies & Practice I](/files/firstyear/aps111.pdf)
