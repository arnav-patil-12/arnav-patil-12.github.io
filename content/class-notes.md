On this page, I've curated a collection of course notes. These notes are mainly final exam review or transcribed textbook/lecture notes. I hope you find them as helpful or insightful as I did while preparing for assessments!

Last Update: APS112 -- LaTeX updates (figured out how apostrophe's work).

## First Year
### Fall
[APS110: Engineering Chemistry and Materials Science](/files/firstyear/aps110.pdf)

[APS111: Engineering Strategies & Practice I](/files/firstyear/aps111.pdf)

*BONUS*: [EHS101](/files/misc/ehs101.pdf), got a GPT to turn handwritten notes into LaTeX.

Unfortunately, I'm unable to share my notes for certain courses :(

### Winter
[APS105: Computer Fundamentals](/files/firstyear/aps105.pdf) (taken in Summer 2024)

[APS106: Fundamentals of Computer Programming](/files/firstyear/aps106.pdf)
