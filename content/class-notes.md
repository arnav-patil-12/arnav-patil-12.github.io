On this page, I've curated a collection of my course notes. These course notes are mainly final exam review or transcribed textbook or lecture notes. While none of these notes packages are full representations of the course, I found them incredibly helpful in preparation for assessments.

Unfortunately, there's some courses, especially in Fall semester of my first year, where I didn't take notes or the notes were provided by the instructor. 

## First Year
### Fall Semester
[APS110: Engineering Chemistry and Materials Science](/files/aps110.pdf)

[APS111: Engineering Strategies & Practice I]()

### Winter Semester
[APS105: Computer Fundamentals](/files/aps105.pdf)

[APS106: Fundamentals of Computer Programming]()

[APS112: Engineering Strategies & Practice II](/files/aps112.pdf)

[ECE110: Electrical Fundamentals](/files/ece110tb.pdf)

[MAT187: Calculus 2]()
