On this page, I've curated a collection of my course notes. These course notes are mainly final exam review or transcribed textbook or lecture notes. **While none of these notes packages are a full representations of the course**, I found them incredibly helpful in preparation for assessments.

Last updated: July 4th, 2024 -- APS106 textbook notes added!
Coming next: MAT187 PCE Notes!

## First Year
### Fall Semester
[APS110: Engineering Chemistry and Materials Science](/files/firstyear/aps110.pdf)

[APS111: Engineering Strategies & Practice I]() (Coming soon!)

[MAT224/MAT188: Linear Algebra]() - tentative, not confirmed

Unfortunately, there's some courses for which I don't have notes available to share: MAT186 and MAT188 because they were provided by the instructor, CIV100 because they're too painful to even gaze upon, and APS100... because I refuse to consider it a "course."

### Winter Semester
[APS106: Fundamentals of Computer Programming](/files/firstyear/aps106.pdf)

[APS112: Engineering Strategies & Practice II](/files/firstyear/aps112.pdf)

ECE110: Electrical Fundamentals [(Textbook Notes)](/files/firstyear/ece110tb.pdf) & [(Lecture Notes)]() (Lecture notes coming soon!)

[MAT187: Calculus 2]() (Coming soon!)

[MIE100: Dynamics](/files/firstyear/mie100.pdf)

### Summer Semester
[APS105: Computer Fundamentals](/files/firstyear/aps105.pdf)

## Second Year
