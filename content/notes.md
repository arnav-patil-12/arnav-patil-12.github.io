I've curated a collection of my course notes on this page. If a course is missing, there are no notes available. 

**Note:** These notes are not meant to serve as a complete study guide; they are meant to provide a preview into the course content.  

# [First Year](/notes/year-one/) 

# [Second Year](/notes/year-two/) 

# [Third Year](/notes/year-three/)
