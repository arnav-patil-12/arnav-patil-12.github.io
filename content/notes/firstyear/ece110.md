## Course Description

[ECE110: Electrical Fundamentals](https://engineering.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/ece110h1) is a course taken by some first-year undergraduate students at the University of Toronto's Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering. This course is taken by students in ECE, Mech, Indy, MSE, and TrackOne. This course provides a review of topics in electricity and magnetism that students may have learned in high school, and introduces topics such as: basic circuit analysis, RC and RL circuits, transient response, and AC steady-state analysis. The required texts for this course are Fundamentals of Physics (12th edition) by Halliday & Resnick, and Basic Engineering Circuit Analysis (12th edition) by Irwin & Nelms.

I took this course in Winter 2024, under [Professor Xilin Liu](https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~xilinliu/), and earned an A+. This was by far my favourite and the most engaging I course I took in first-year. While the content was extensive and challenging, it is easy to do well in this course if you're willing to put your nose to the grindstone. ECE110 also has a significant lab component, which introduces students to equipment they'll use in upper years.
