## Course Description

I didn't take [MAT224: Linear Algebra II](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/mat224h1) myself, but after MAT188 was done kicking my ass, I knew I wanted to take some time in the summer to review linear algebra. So, when I noticed this course covers mostly the same content as MAT188 with a little extra, I ordered the course textbook, *A Course in Linear Algebra* by Damiano and Little. 

Uploading the notes for this "course" will be a slow process on the reader's end as I'll be meticulously reading each chapter and completing it's associated exercises, uploading notes only when a chapter (or section) is finished. I don't expect to finish the whole textbook within the summer, but I'll see how far I can get.
