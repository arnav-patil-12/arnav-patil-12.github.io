## Course Description

[Engineering Strategies & Practice (ESP)](https://www.engineering.utoronto.ca/engineering-strategies-practice/) is a two-course program within the first-year curriculum at University of Toronto's Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering. These are introductory design courses, meaning that students work in teams on projects brought forward by real-life clients. In the fall semester, all groups work on one of a few projects brought forward by the same client (Hart House in my year, and Sidney Smith Commons the year prior). In the winter semester, however, teams work on projects that come a wide variety of clients at UofT and in industry. The primary text for this course is [Designing Engineers: An Introductory Text](https://www.wiley.com/en-ca/Designing+Engineers%3A+An+Introductory+Text%2C+1st+Edition-p-9780470939499), written mostly by University of Toronto professors.

**This notes package is in no way a complete representation of the course.** That being said, these notes do a good job of covering the content that will be covered in the final exam. My notes for the next course, APS112 (ESP II), can be found [here](https://arnav-patil-12.github.io/files/firstyear/aps112.pdf).

I originally planned on writing these notes in LaTeX, but after looking at the way I've structured them in my notebook, I decided that my left hand is a better text editor. So, I took the liberty of scanning them instead.
