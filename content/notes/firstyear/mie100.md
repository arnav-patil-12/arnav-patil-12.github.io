## Course Description

[MIE100: Dynamics](https://engineering.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/mie100h1) is a course taken by some first-year undergraduates at the University of Toronto's Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering. The disciplines that take this course are: Mech, Indy, ECE, and TrackOne. The course is meant to be a continuation of the physics learned in CIV100, with the focus now on moving bodies (dynamics) rather than stationary ones (statics).

I took this course under [Professor Fatemeh Jazinizadeh](https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/faculty_staff/jazinizadeh/) in Winter 2024, and ended the class with an A. I found the course to be well-paced, straightforward, and entertaining; I would rank it as my second favourite class of the winter semester. There is great controversy over whether this course is more challenging than CIV100, and while I did find MIE100 considerably easier than CIV100, I will also say that it's a matter of one's background and interests. My high school physics curriculum focussed heavily on dynamics, so I was able to pick up the course quite easily.
