## Course Description

[MAT188: Linear Algebra](https://engineering.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/mat188h1) is a course at the University of Toronto's Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering. This is a standard first course in linear algebra, and is one of the five courses taken by ALL engineering undergraduates in the Fall semester of their first year. 

I took this course in Fall 2023 under Professor Camelia Karimianpour. This course is, on paper, not terribly challenging, and definitely not the hardest of the courses taken by first-year undergraduates. But for a variety of reasons, this course thoroughly kicked my butt, espcially the final exam. That being said, I did find the content enjoyable, but I definitely advise the reader to spend a lot (A LOT) of time doing homework questions for this course.
