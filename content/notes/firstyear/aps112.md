# Engineering Strategies & Practice II

## Notes
[Lecture Notes + Textbook Excerpts](/files/firstyear/aps112.pdf)

## Course Description

[Engineering Strategies & Practice (ESP)](https://www.engineering.utoronto.ca/engineering-strategies-practice/) is a two-course program within the first-year curriculum at University of Toronto's Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering. These are introductory design courses, meaning that students work in teams on projects brought forward by real-life clients. In the fall semester, all groups work on one of a few projects brought forward by the same client (Hart House in my year, and Sidney Smith Commons the year prior). In the winter semester, however, teams work on projects that come a wide variety of clients at UofT and in industry. The primary text for this course is [Designing Engineers: An Introductory Text](https://www.wiley.com/en-ca/Designing+Engineers%3A+An+Introductory+Text%2C+1st+Edition-p-9780470939499), written mostly by University of Toronto professors.

**This notes package is in no way a complete representation of the course.** That being said, this notes do a good job of covering the content that will be covered in the midterm assessment, which is all the textbook readings from the winter semester. Know that everything you lean in APS111 (ESP I) also applies to this course.

There is one topic not covered well in the textbook -- reading & making Gantt Charts. There will be, without doubt, at least a few questions on Gantt Charts, and this website is a good tool to recheck (or gain) your knowledge of them https://blog.ganttpro.com/en/ultimate-guide-gantt-charts/.
