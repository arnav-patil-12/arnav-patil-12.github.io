# APS110: Engineering Chemistry and Materials Science
[APS110: Engineering Chemistry and Materials Science](https://engineering.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/aps110h1) is a course at the University of Toronto's Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering. According to the Faculty's Academic Calendar, the course is built on the principle of the structure-property relationship. This is one of the five courses taken by ALL undergraduates in the Fall semester of their first year.

I took this course in Fall 2023 under [Professor Scott Ramsay](https://mse.utoronto.ca/faculty-staff/professors/ramsay/). While heavy in content, this course was also my favourite among those I took in my first semester of university. I doubt I will ever encounter content from this course again in my degree; regardless, I enjoyed this course and its thrice-weekly 9 AM lectures fueled by the Myhal Second Cup.

**This notes package is in no way a complete representation of the course.** That being said, these notes cover all the content in the textbook and lectures. I used the original Goodnotes version of these notes to study for both the midterm and final exam.

These notes were transcribed from my original notes for this course, found here [click me!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PhSvYCIOx4ujp8-Ozx7pI8I4Urd6kVRH/view?usp=share_link). This document was written in LaTeX using Overleaf; the source project can be viewed here [click me!](https://www.overleaf.com/read/kmddzjrqrtsv#06a3f5).
