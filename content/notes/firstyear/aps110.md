## Course Description

[APS110: Engineering Chemistry and Materials Science](https://engineering.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/aps110h1) is a course at the University of Toronto's Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering. According to the Academic Calendar, the course is built on the principle of the structure-property relationship. This is one of the five courses taken by ALL undergraduates in the Fall semester of their first year.

I took this course in Fall 2023 under [Professor Scott Ramsay](https://mse.utoronto.ca/faculty-staff/professors/ramsay/). While heavy in content, this course was also my favourite among those I took in my first semester of university. I doubt I will ever encounter content from this course again in my degree; regardless, I enjoyed this course and its thrice-weekly 9:00 AM lectures fueled by the Myhal Second Cup.
