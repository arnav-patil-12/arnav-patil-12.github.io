# Programming Fundamentals (C++)

## Notes
[Textbook Notes](/files/secondyear/ece244.pdf) 

## Course Description
Copying from the Academic Calendar until I can write my own description of the course:

Provides a foundation in programming using an object-oriented programming language. Topics include: classes and objects, inheritance, basic data structures (linked lists, binary trees, and hash tables), big-O complexity analysis, and testing and debugging. The laboratory assignments emphasize the use of object-oriented programming constructs in the design and implementation of reasonably large programs.
