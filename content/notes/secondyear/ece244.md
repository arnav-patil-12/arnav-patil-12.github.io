# Programming Fundamentals (C++)

## Notes
[Textbook Notes](/files/secondyear/ece244.pdf) 

## Course Description
A pretty standard course in C++. While a lot of the content was straightforward, most of the labs were quite boring as (in my opinion) they didn't showcase the full potential of low-level programming. I wish we got more labs like the circuit simulation one, as it most closely related to what we were learning in other courses. 

Computer-based midterm and final exam were also a nightmare for me personally (and for the teaching team logisitically, it seems). Pen and paper remain to this day my preferred IDE.
