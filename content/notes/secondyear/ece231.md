# Introductory Electronics

## Notes
[Textbook Notes](/files/secondyear/ece231.pdf) (Note: Chapter 3 on semiconductors is missing from these notes, but this unit is not heavily emphasized at all)

## Course Description
The year I took this course was the first year of it being offered in the fall; it was previously offered in the winter, with ECE212: Circuit Analysis being it's fall prerequisite. There's quite a few factors that led to it being offered in the fall instead (Faculty politics being one of them, I imagine). That being said, anyone who passed [ECE110](/content/notes/firstyear/ece110.md) is capable of doing well in this course. However, anyone who comes into this course without having taken ECE110, most likely transfers from outside MIE/ECE (and EngSci maybe?), will struggle for quite a bit as the course now heavily relies on students having learned RLC circuits and transient analysis previously. 

The first few labs are quite boring but they're a good chance to learn how to actually use the lab equipment (I still don't know how to use the oscilloscope lol), but after that, they become very fun. Bare in mind, they are overall more challenging and time-consuming than labs in ECE110; so make sure you do the prelab well and be smart with your time when in the lab.
