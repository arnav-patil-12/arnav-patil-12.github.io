[Textbook + Readings Notes Repo](https://github.com/arnav-patil-12/mat291-notes) 

## Course Description
Copying from the Academic Calendar until I can write my own description of the course:

The chain rule for functions of several variables; the gradient, directional derivative, tangent plane and small signal modeling and Jacobians. Multiple integrals; change of variables and Jacobians, line integrals: parametric and explicit representations, the divergence and curl of a vector field, surface integrals; parametric and explicit representations, multi-variable Dirac Delta distribution, superposition of vector fields, Helmholtz decomposition theorem, Divergence theorem and Stokes' theorem and application from electromagnetic fields.
