## Course Description
A very computationally heavy course; nearly all the marks I lost were because I made computation errors. Make good use of the instructor-provided course notes, and complete as many practice problems as possible. Pay good attention to what shows up on the quizzes and during the final lecture where the instructors go over what will show up on the final. Don't waste your time learning concepts for the low-weighted questions and what's not even in scope for the final.
