# Digital Systems (with Verilog)

## Notes
[Textbook Notes](/files/secondyear/ece241.pdf) 

## Course Description
Copying from the Academic Calendar until I can write my own description of the course:

Digital logic circuit design with substantial hands-on laboratory work. Algebraic and truth table representation of logic functions and variables. Optimizations of combinational logic, using "don't cares." Multi-level logic optimization. Transistor-level design of logic gates; propagation delay and timing of gates and circuits. The Verilog hardware description language. Memory in digital circuits, including latches, clocked flip-flops, and Static Random Access Memory. Set-up and hold times of sequential logic. Finite state machines - design and implementation. Binary number representation, hardware addition and multiplication. Tri-state gates, and multiplexers. There is a major lab component using Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and associated computer-aided design software.
