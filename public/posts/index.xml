			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I want to continue what I started with the first blog post on discussing first-year courses.</p>
<h1 id="1st-ece241">1st: ECE241</h1>
<h2 id="my-review">My Review</h2>
<ul>
<li>You learn a lot of content but don&rsquo;t dive too deep into it; if you&rsquo;re especially interested in something, you need to learn it on your own.</li>
<li>Labs are quite fun, if not the greatest olfactory experience. They reflect lecture content and teach out about digital hardware design/verification.</li>
<li>As daunting as the project seems, much of the stress/pressure is what students bring on themselves; the instructors&rsquo; expectations for the project are significantly lower than what I thought they&rsquo;d be.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>ModelSim ModelSim ModelSim (did I forget ModelSim?)</li>
<li>Practice your Boolean algebra consistently instead of trying to cram it all before the midterm and the final.</li>
<li>Make good use of the textbook, it&rsquo;s well-written for a second year audience.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="2nd-ece231">2nd: ECE231</h1>
<h2 id="my-review-1">My Review</h2>
<ul>
<li>Course schedule was unclear at times, and the instructors aren&rsquo;t on the same page regarding what should be taught and when.</li>
<li>Content itself is great and sets a good foundation for future electronics courses.</li>
<li>The first two or three labs are quite a snooze but they pick up in iddifculty (and in how fun they are) very quickly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tips-1">Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>In addition to the pre-lab exercises, take a good luck at what you&rsquo;ll be doing in the lab itself. It will save you a lot of time debugging and you won&rsquo;t be as dependent on the TAs, who are busy.</li>
<li>It seems easy to get away with memorizing a lof of the content in the course, but I believe doing that stops you from actually learning anything.</li>
<li>Remember that even if you get lost or stuck on a question, you can solve any problem in the whole course using just Ohm&rsquo;s Law, Kirchoff&rsquo;s Laws, and element equations.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="3rd-mat290">3rd: MAT290</h1>
<h2 id="my-review-2">My Review</h2>
<ul>
<li>Two sections being significantly behind the other two made studying for the weekly quizzes quite annoying as we&rsquo;d be doing questions on content covered one or two weeks ago.</li>
<li>The course covers a lot of content but does a good job of tying everything together by the end of the course.</li>
<li>We could benefit from learning more engineering applications than just basic RLC circuits that we already know how to solve.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tips-2">Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Practice makes better.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t rely too much on the past quizzes.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="4th-ece244">4th: ECE244</h1>
<h2 id="my-review-3">My Review</h2>
<ul>
<li>A pretty standard programming course.</li>
<li>The first and last two labs were extremely boring but the middle two made me a little more optimistic about programming and it&rsquo;s applications.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tips-3">Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use the reference executables when in doubt.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t bother doing the textbook problems; just do the past midterms and exams they&rsquo;re taken from.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="5th-mat291">5th: MAT291</h1>
<h2 id="my-review-4">My Review</h2>
<ul>
<li>Again, practice makes better.</li>
<li>Use the textbook and the instructor-provided lecture notes. They cover far more content and examples than what is actually presented in the lecture.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tips-4">Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>I actually had no clue what I was doing throughout this course I can&rsquo;t really say anything :(</li>
</ul>

			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I&rsquo;ve received a lot of DMs from incoming Frosh on Discord and LinkedIn asking me to give feedback on first-year courses, I&rsquo;ve decided to provide my advice for each course.</p>
<h1 id="fall-semester">Fall Semester</h1>
<h2 id="aps100-orientation-to-engineering">APS100: Orientation to Engineering</h2>
<ul>
<li>Grading for assignments is abritrary and harsh &ndash; so don&rsquo;t skip tutorials (you might need the tutorial grades).</li>
<li>Get to know your TA and listen when they talk about their experiences.</li>
<li>Make note of the resources they provide &ndash; even though the lecture delivery is questionable, you might find yourself needing the resources.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="aps110-engineering-chemistry-and-materials-science">APS110: Engineering Chemistry and Materials Science</h2>
<ul>
<li>Take good textbook notes, then add extra content covered in lectures.</li>
<li>Highly recommend attending Prof. Ramsay&rsquo;s 9:00 AM lectures.</li>
<li>Use Prof. Ramsay&rsquo;s videos to revisit any content you didn&rsquo;t understand the first time.</li>
<li>Tutorials are generally good, and they&rsquo;re helpful to attend around quiz/midterm time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="aps111-engineering-strategies-and-practice-i">APS111: Engineering Strategies and Practice I</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pay attention to the readings, they&rsquo;re more helpful than you might first think.</li>
<li>Buy full-year access to the Perusall textbook, there&rsquo;s more material to cover in APS112.</li>
<li>This semester will either genuinely make you wonder how some of your classmates were accepted into UofT Engineering or leave you with your new best friends.</li>
<li>Make sure you use every opportunity to earn the extra PD points though, as only 10 PD points will add a whole percentage to your final grade!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="civ100-mechanics">CIV100: Mechanics</h2>
<ul>
<li>Aaaah yes, the course with the highest first-year kill count.</li>
<li>I wish I had put more effort into this course, especially by doing more practice problems, and asking my questions earlier.</li>
<li>If you like it, good for you, but if you&rsquo;re indifferent to this course, just do your best to pass and move on.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mat186-calculus-i">MAT186: Calculus I</h2>
<ul>
<li>Essentially everything you&rsquo;ve covered in calculus till date (with the addition of some topics in ODEs, I really hope they keep that this year).</li>
<li>Midterms and assignments were a bit funky, and as class rep I always had people complaining that they got zeroes on the assignments because they forgot to sign the academic integrity statement (so don&rsquo;t forget to do that).</li>
<li>While I did poorly in this course, there are other reasons I wasn&rsquo;t a big fan of it: I had a few run-ins with a TA and a professor that really jaded my view, and I made sure to let them know during course evals.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mat188-linear-algebra">MAT188: Linear Algebra</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pay attention to the course readings, and make good use of the textbook if you don&rsquo;t understand any of the content discussed in class.</li>
<li>This was also a course where I regretted not spending more effort to do more practice problems and past midterms.</li>
<li>Learn MATLAB, you&rsquo;ll very likely be using it in your upper-year courses.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="winter-semester">Winter Semester</h1>
<h2 id="aps105-computer-fundamentals-taken-summer-2024">APS105: Computer Fundamentals (taken Summer 2024)</h2>
<ul>
<li>A much better programming course compared to its counterpart (APS106).</li>
<li>One thing that did strike me, however, is that the pace of the content was easily manageable in the summer despite being accelerated (fall-winter courses are four months, summer is less than 2); this made me wonder about the pace of the course during the winter semester.</li>
<li>Overall, a good course, and it&rsquo;s the only course that is mandatory for transfers into ECE.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="aps106-fundamentals-of-computer-programming">APS106: Fundamentals of Computer Programming</h2>
<ul>
<li>A generic first course in computer programming using Python.</li>
<li>I went into this course with no prior coding experience, and found it extremely straightforward with consistent practice.</li>
<li>Make sure you understand what&rsquo;s going on in the labs, and <strong>use the lower averages to ride the curve to the top LOL.</strong></li>
<li>I will also say that as an Indy (industrial engineering student) at the time of taking this course, I found that APS105 (C) would have been much better preparation for second-year programming courses.</li>
</ul>
<p>This course will at some point become EXT&rsquo;d for me because I don&rsquo;t need it as an ECE student. But until then, I&rsquo;ll take the extra boost on my GPA!</p>
<h2 id="aps112-engineering-strategies-and-practice-ii">APS112: Engineering Strategies and Practice II</h2>
<ul>
<li>No comments. Like ESP I but worse in most ways.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ece110-electrical-fundamentals">ECE110: Electrical Fundamentals</h2>
<ul>
<li>W course, W content, W professors (especially Xilin Liu). By far my favourite and one of the easiest courses of winter semester.</li>
<li>Some of you may have an advantage in that you&rsquo;ve covered part of the content. Use the textbook if you don&rsquo;t understand the E&amp;M concepts, and attend tutorials for the circuits part because it&rsquo;s free practice for solving circuits (trust me you&rsquo;ll be needing it).</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t bother putting down past questions and exams on your cheatsheet, it&rsquo;s not worth it &ndash; instead, focus on including important concepts and proceudres, see <a href="/files/firstyear/ece110formulae.pdf">the one I used in my final exam</a>, for example.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mat187-calculus-ii">MAT187: Calculus II</h2>
<ul>
<li>Well-taught course for the most part (I only really took issue with the methods used to teach the sequences and series unit).</li>
<li>As an ECE/MIE/T1 student, you&rsquo;ll learn all of the last unit (vector-valued calculus) in MIE100, and I have heard rumblings of that being taken out of the curriculum.</li>
<li>Practice practice practice!!!!!! Learn your lessons from Calc I and Linear Algebra.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mie100-dynamics">MIE100: Dynamics</h2>
<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s generally a lot of controversy over which course is harder between CIV100 and MIE100. I think that it comes down to what you learned in high school physics; the Alberta high school physics curriculum puts more emphasis on dynamics over statics, which is why I found this course significantly easier.</li>
<li>The teaching team is great, and the support they provide makes MIE100 a better course than CIV100 any day.</li>
<li>Make sure you understand the assignment questions and the examples covered in class, everything on the midterm and exam will be a combination of something you&rsquo;ve seen before.</li>
<li>Oh, and don&rsquo;t forget to draw reaction forces for simple harmonic motion diagrams! (see that happened to my buddy once)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mie191-intro-to-mechanical-and-industrial-engineering">MIE191: Intro to Mechanical and Industrial Engineering</h2>
<ul>
<li>Great seminar course, highly recommend attending.</li>
<li>You get to learn a lot of cool things about your discipline such as what industry and research opportunities are available.</li>
<li>Keep in mind not all 191 courses are structured the same, for example, to earn a CR in ECE191, you have to attend 9/12 lectures, whereas in MIE191 you need to finish a short assignment at the start and end of the semester.</li>
</ul>
