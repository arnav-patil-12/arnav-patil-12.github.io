      <description>I receive a lot of DMs asking me to give feedback on second-year ECE courses, so here I&amp;rsquo;ve provided the class average of each course and my best piece of advice for success in the course.&#xA;Fall Semester ECE231: Introductory Electronics (C+) Don&amp;rsquo;t try to memorize the circuit types and different types of problems, make sure you understand why they work the way they do. ECE241: Digital Systems (C+) Practice your Boolean Algebra, it makes up a large portion of your midterm (which again is a large portion of your grade).</description>

      <description>I receive a lot of DMs asking me to give feedback on first-year engineering courses, so here I&amp;rsquo;ve provided the class average of each course and my best piece of advice for success in the course.&#xA;Fall Semester APS100: Orientation to Engineering (H/P/F) Get to know your TA and listen when they talk about their experiences, they were once in your shoes and have valuable advice for how to make the best of your student experience, whether it comes to careers, clubs, or school-life balance.</description>

      <description>I’m studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto, where I enjoy working at the intersection of hardware and software, especially computer architecture and digital design.&#xA;In summer 2025, I interned as an FPGA engineer at Prof. Roman Genov’s Intelligent Sensory Microsystems Lab (ISML), refining my Verilog skills and dabbling in digital design.&#xA;Currently, I&amp;rsquo;m TA&amp;rsquo;ing APS100 (Orientation to Engineering), helping first-year students transition into university life. Next summer, I’ll be joining Marvell as a Digital IC Design Intern for my PEY!</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve curated a collection of my course notes on this page. If a course is missing, there are no notes available.&#xA;Note: These notes are not meant to serve as a complete study guide; they are meant to provide a preview into the course content.&#xA;First Year Second Year Third Year </description>
