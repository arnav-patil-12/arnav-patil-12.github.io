      <description>My name is Arnav, and I&amp;rsquo;m a second-year student studying Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of Toronto, with a double Minor in Artificial Intelligence and Engineering Business. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in exploring topics in computer hardware and machine intelligence. Outside of classes, I&amp;rsquo;m involved with the University of Toronto Engineering Society and the IEEE University of Toronto Student Branch.&#xA;Feel free to reach out, I&amp;rsquo;m always looking to connect!</description>

      <description>Computer Fundamentals Notes Textbook Notes + Lecture Excerpts&#xA;Course Description APS105: Computer Fundamentals is a first-year programming course taken by undergraduate students at the University of Toronto&amp;rsquo;s Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering. Though any first-year may opt to take this course, it is a prerequisite for second-year studies in Electrical and Computer Engineering. It is also taken by most TrackOne (general engineering) students. This course teaches students to code in the C programming language; the other disciplines, and those who opt not to learn C, take APS106: Fundamentals of Computer Programming (which teaches Python).</description>

      <description>Engineering Strategies &amp;amp; Practice I Notes Lecture Notes + Textbook Excerpts&#xA;Course Description Engineering Strategies &amp;amp; Practice (ESP) is a two-course program within the first-year curriculum at University of Toronto&amp;rsquo;s Faculty of Applied Science &amp;amp; Engineering. These are introductory design courses, meaning that students work in teams on projects brought forward by real-life clients. In the fall semester, all groups work on one of a few projects brought forward by the same client (Hart House in my year, and Sidney Smith Commons the year prior).</description>
