      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;ve received a lot of DMs from incoming Frosh on Discord and LinkedIn asking me to give feedback on first-year courses, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to provide my comments on each course, as well as its course average.&#xA;Fall Semester APS100: Orientation to Engineering Great course in theory but not so much in practice. APS100 is meant to introduce a lot of the Faculty&amp;rsquo;s and University&amp;rsquo;s resources to students, and also help us get on our feet through assignments such as creating a task list and weekly schedule.</description>
